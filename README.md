# Treebeard

Ruby API wrapper for [lichess.org](https://lichess.org)

Incomplete, lacking some stuff like the ability to challenge AI & tournament stuff. 
I'll probably add it at some point but I have no plans to do it now. 

Dependencies are for you to figure out yourself because I don't care.
Also untested as of this commit.

`gem "treebeard", :git => "git://github.com/boeotian/treebeard.git"`
